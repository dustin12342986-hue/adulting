/**
 * Adulting / Blue Bonnet — Cloudflare Worker proxy.
 *
 * This is the full Worker script. Paste this whole thing over your existing
 * Worker's code (Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → your worker →
 * "Edit code"), replacing everything, then click Deploy.
 *
 * Why you need this update: Blue Bonnet can now actually perform actions in
 * the app (add a bill, check off a chore, log groceries, etc.) when you ask
 * in chat. That requires the app to send Anthropic a `tools` list describing
 * what it's allowed to do. Your existing Worker only forwarded
 * model/max_tokens/system/messages and silently dropped `tools`, so tool
 * actions wouldn't work until this is deployed.
 *
 * One-time setup reminders (same as before, nothing new here):
 *   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY must be set as a Worker secret
 *     (Settings → Variables and Secrets → Add → name it ANTHROPIC_API_KEY).
 *   - ALLOWED_ORIGIN below must exactly match where Adulting is hosted
 *     (e.g. "https://your-username.github.io" — origin only, no path,
 *     no trailing slash). Update it if you haven't already pointed it at
 *     your live GitHub Pages URL.

    /* Model is chosen by the app now, not hardcoded here.

       Statement extraction is mechanical work that a small model does just as
       well as a large one, for a fraction of the cost — but only if this Worker
       actually honours what the app asks for. It used to ignore incoming.model
       entirely, so every call ran on the expensive model no matter what.

       Allowlisted rather than passed straight through, so a bad request can't
       point this Worker (and your API key) at something unexpected. */
